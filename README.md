# Daily Leetcode Bot

Unofficial bot in Python. This is mostly a collection of functions that give you common data and posts according to its daily schedule. More methods to come.
This bot does weird stuff in terms of posting random leetcode problems using the leetcode api.

## Setup

Python packages have to be installed.
```
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create the file `.venv`  in the root directory to store your bot token. Without the token your bot will not work! Add a `TOKEN` attribute in the first line of the file as such:
```
TOKEN=<example-token-1234>
```
Thats it, now it is ready to go. **Do not post your token publicly. Make sure to exclude it from your repo.** 

## TODO
- Ability to host leetcode competitions to see who finished the problem first and so on.
